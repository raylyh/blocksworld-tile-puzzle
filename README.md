Blocksworld Tile Puzzle

## Description
AI Coursework assignment
An ‘agent’ moves in a simulated NxN grid world with the goal of building towers of blocks. Each grid space contains either a ‘tile’ or the agent. Some tiles have letters on them – these are the ‘blocks’. All the other tiles are white. The agent moves up/down/left/right (except where borders prevent it). As the agent moves, the tile that they move onto slides under them into the position that they just came from (see 8-puzzle). Some examples of moves are given overleaf. The exact start state and goal state for the assignment is shown below. The goal is to build a tower, with these exact blocks in these exact positions as shown. The position of the agent at the end doesn’t matter.
